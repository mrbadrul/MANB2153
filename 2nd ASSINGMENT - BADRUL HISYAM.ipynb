    "1. DoS Attack Detection Based on Naive Bayes Classifier  : This paper explain the needs to construct an effective detection of Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks since DOS attacks can cause serious damage to the services running on the victim. The data used as training data contains network traffic records abrupt traffic changes across multiple network domains at captured at a particular time depicting different attribute the earliest time. The technique proposed is to apply the naïve bayes predictions of the traffic flows(Intrusion Detection by Naive Bayes). This scheme may include flow correlation information into the classification process, allowing it to it identify attacks that occur in uncertain conditions. \n",

    "2. Using Naive Bayes Algorithm in detection of hate tweets : This paper proposed to develop a reliable tool for detecting hate tweets since Social Media has been not only for information sharing but also for hateful speech towards certain individual or group of people. the dataset is constructed from streamed tweets with the help of Tweepy library in python.the technique proposed is to used library of Python, Scikit-learn that support of multinomial naïve Bayes classifiers.\n",

    "6. On Building Decision Trees from Large-scale Data in Applications of On-line Advertising : This paper explain on key scientific problem that determines the health and profitability of advertising systems: the problem of predicting click-through rates and related probabilities. The dataset used is The GD and NGD data sets that are prepared from traffic logged at Yahoo as well as the data set from the 2012 KDD Cup challenge. By applying decission trees as they naturally handle categorical features, they proposed to equip decision trees to handle the high arities found in advertising data by employing an efficient procedure to cluster feature-values based on their output responses. \n",

The early prediction of the student’s grade can help the principals to take decisions in order to help schools to initially identify students with low academic achievement and find ways to support them. The datasets used is The Dataset of the students of the 11th Grade of scientific branch at Gaza Strip secondary schools contains 13 parameters, 11 parameters of the subject’s marks, average parameter and Grade parameter. This study focus onz predicting the student’s performance according to their marks through classification using modified KNN classifiers such as Cosine KNN, Cubic KNN, and Weighted KNN."
